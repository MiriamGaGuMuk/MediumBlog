# Enjoy the path

As a society full of **“must do”** at a certain age, the pressure is big, what I have done all my life is going against this belief. No matter what you do, is never enough for the rest of the people.

I always had this feeling of no belong to conventional education or society thought, why the teacher had the last word? why life has to have this structure to consider you a winner? whys and whys get to my mind every time I was in a class or in a sudden moment, I don’t know if it’s right or not, but for me works and in many ways has made me happy. At the start, I felt like a loser, failed, but then again I learned the most incredible lesson of my life, I discover the self-learning and since then I never look back again.

I started learning English, here is where I discover one of my long list of passions, languages. I never stop trying anything, just keep going, no matter how hard and ugly the road became.

A couple of months ago I met someone that introduce me to a magical world, coding. I have always loved the tech world, I lived earning money from this without having studied in any academy, but this was different, it blows my mind since the very first code line that I made, I got caught.

Less than a month a bad experience almost kept that from me, the love that I found at making this lines, I felt bad, depression and disappointment almost take it away from me what I have fought so hard to learn this year. But I found the strength in my weakness. Now I’m again on the game at __MUKTEK Academy__, starting all over again, so **LET’S DO THIS!**

Just to close this little chapter and the main point of all these thoughts, although it sounds trite as if taken from a self-help book **“NEVER GIVE UP”** and most important never stop believing in yourself, cause at the end you only have you, and you are the most important person in your life.

Thanks for reading. :+1: :octocat:
